# Wealth Tracker

This is the fifth project from the 20 Vanilla JS Projects Course by Brad Traversy.

I decided to do this course to help solidify and strengthen my JS/HTML/CSS skills for projects.

## Project Specifications

- Fetch random users from the [randomuser.me](https://randomuser.me) API
- Use forEach() to loop and output user/wealth
- Use map() to double wealth
- Use filter() to filter only millionaires
- Use sort() to sort by wealth
- Use reduce() to add all wealth
